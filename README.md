# Apples To Apples
## Description
This is a version of Apples to Apples to be played via terminal. The game needs 3 or more players. Like normal apples to apples, green cards will have a certain word, but not like normal apples to apples, the players have to choose a word/phrase/description to match the green card (i.e. the players make up a red card). This is meant to be a "pass and play" game, so the "red cards" that the players enter will not be hidden as a password would be, but instead the terminal is cleared after a given player enters their "red card". Like normal apples to apples, the winner of a round will get a point and become the judge for the next round. The game ends at the players' discretion, unless all green cards are used up. 
## How to Play
I used Python version 3.10.9, but I'm sure other versions work as well. Just `git clone` the repository and `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project directory. Then run `python Main.py` and follow the prompts. Very simple. 
## Other notes
This was a project I made on a road trip with my family. I don't plan on updating it much, just an FYI if things become broken in the future.
